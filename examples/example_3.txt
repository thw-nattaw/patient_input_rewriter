Patient Input
"I just haven’t been feeling like myself lately. 
It’s hard to explain, but something feels off, not sick exactly, just not right."

Formal HPI
"The patient reports a recent and persistent sensation of being unwell, 
although unable to specify a particular symptom or illness. 
She describes a general feeling of being "off" and not herself, 
characterized by a vague sense of unease rather than overt sickness. 
The patient is unable to provide further details regarding the onset, duration, or exacerbating factors contributing to this sensation."

Lately, I've been experiencing a general sense of unease and feeling out of sorts.
